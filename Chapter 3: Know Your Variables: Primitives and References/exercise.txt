Based on what you know about the size and type of the primitive variables, see
if you can figure out which of these are legal and which aren’t. We haven’t
covered all the rules yet, so on some of these you’ll have to use your best
judgment. Tip: The compiler always errs on the side of safety.

1. int x = 34.5; // illegal -> no integer
2. boolean boo = x; // illegal -> value must either be True of False
3. int g = 17; // legal
4. int y = g; // legal
5. y = y + 10 // legal
6. short s; // legal
7. s = y; // illegal -> here y is an 32-bit int var, doesn't fit in 16-bit
			short var
8. byte b = 3; // legal
9. byte v = b; // legal
10. short n = 12; // legal
11. v = n; // illegal -> here n is a 16-bit shor var, doesn't fit in 8-bit
			 byte var
12. byte k = 128; // illegal -> 8-bit signed integer at max 127
